## Overview of Project:
This analysis measures the risk of an organization as a portion of its tenure work force nears retirement.  They can brace for impact or levergae remaining time or come up with creative incentives to knowledge share with younger generations of employees.

### Results: 
- Running a distinct count on the table housing retired employees and their titles shows that more than 90,000 employees could be retiring of the 300,000 in the employee table:

- Further inspection shows a need to clean data further.  Some of the employees above have already retired or left the company.  Restricting the table to only those still employed shows that more than 72,000 employees could be retiring of the 300,000 in the employee table:

### Recommendations:
- Resist the urge to send more drivers to the rural area.  The number of Rural drivers is 13% that of the Urban drivers but their total fares is 9% that of Urban total fares.  Each Urban driver even with the lower average fare still generates more overall income for Pyber.
- Collect more data on why average fares are higher in rural areas.  Is ride time the only factor?  Or does a lack of drivers increase higher frequency of surge pricing.  A short supply of drivers in rural areas could signal a lack of supply, untapped demand, and result in higher revenue for the company but could negatively impact average fare per driver.  
- Encourage rural drivers to venture into the suburbs or urban cities during the middle of the month.  Ride count in rural areas is its highest at the beginning of the month and the end but dips mid-month. That pattern isn’t as apparent in the other areas so there is opportunity for those drivers to benefit personally as well as increase total fare for the company.
