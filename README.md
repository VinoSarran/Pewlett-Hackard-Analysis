## Overview of Project:
This analysis measures the risk of an organization as a portion of its tenure work force nears retirement.  They can brace for impact or levergae remaining time or come up with creative incentives to knowledge share with younger generations of employees.

### Results: 
- From the ride sharing data collected between 01/01/2019 and 04/29/2019, we see that urban, suburban, and rural fares do not fluctuate greatly but are vastly different in their total fares and average fares per driver:

- Rural Rides have the lowest count but those riders generate more revenue per ride.  Conversely, Urban Rides have the highest count but the lowest revenue per ride.  As you can guess, Suburban performance falls in the middle:

### Recommendations:
- Resist the urge to send more drivers to the rural area.  The number of Rural drivers is 13% that of the Urban drivers but their total fares is 9% that of Urban total fares.  Each Urban driver even with the lower average fare still generates more overall income for Pyber.
- Collect more data on why average fares are higher in rural areas.  Is ride time the only factor?  Or does a lack of drivers increase higher frequency of surge pricing.  A short supply of drivers in rural areas could signal a lack of supply, untapped demand, and result in higher revenue for the company but could negatively impact average fare per driver.  
- Encourage rural drivers to venture into the suburbs or urban cities during the middle of the month.  Ride count in rural areas is its highest at the beginning of the month and the end but dips mid-month. That pattern isn’t as apparent in the other areas so there is opportunity for those drivers to benefit personally as well as increase total fare for the company.
